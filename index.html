    <h5 id="border-sss">Hello! My name is Pisal I’m 14 years old boy , I’m studying in 
Liger leadership Academy every day. I’m really proud of myself and my parent that 
they let me come and study in Liger, Liger is a really great school that can teach
Cambodian kids to have more knowledge and to be better and know more about our own country. 
I want to say thanks full to Liger leadership Academy to let me study here and get to know more 
about my own country to. In Liger leadership Academy has so many teacher to teach us and they are so 
friendly with us when we have wrong something they try to tell us in the great way and tell us no to
do that again. So My favorite subject in Liger leadership Academy is Math but you know what Math is
the one of the subject that I’m not really good at it but I like math, every day I’m try to study
more math with my friend in my free time and I also try to ask my teacher with the thing that I don’t 
understand and try to understand more of math.
